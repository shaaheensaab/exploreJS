1. JavaScript code blocks will work or not it depends on 'Conditional Statement'. It decides code executions.
    Formally, Conditions are-
    *Statements that are created by the programmer.
    *Evaluates actions in the program.
    *Evaluates if it's true or false.

2. What are conditions in JS?
    #Condition-1: If you finish today's module. Then you'll get access to tomorrow's module on time.
    *if(todaysModule == finish){
        console.log("tomorrow's module will unlock on time!");
    }

    *if(todaysModule == finish){
        console.log("tomorrow's module will unlock on time!");
    }
    else{
        console.log("tomorrow's module will not unlock on time.");
    }

    #Condition-2: If you get less than 50% marks in any assignment. Then you'll not allow to get SCIC.
    *if(assignmentMarks < "50_percent"){
        console.log("You're not allowed to SCIC.");
    }

    *if(assignmentMarks < "50_percent"){
        console.log("You're not allowed to SCIC.");
    }
    else{
        console.log("Congratulations! You got SCIC.");
    }

    #Condition-3: If you stick with the course. You'll get a job one day.
    *if(courseCompleted == "Yesss"){
        console.log("You'll get a job!");
    }

    *if(courseCompleted == "Yesss"){
        console.log("You'll get a job");
    }
    else{
        console.log("You'll get punishment of fate.");
    }

3. What is loop? How it works?
    -In JavaScript, a loop uses to execute a specific code snippet repeatedly depending on a condition.
    Formally, loops are used-
    *To execute the same block of code repeatedly.
    *It runs until a certain condition is met.

4. What is FOR LOOP?
    *let a;
    for(a = 1; a < 5; a++){
        console.log(a);
    }

    Output: 1, 2, 3, 4

5. What is WHILE LOOP?
    *let a = 1;
    while(a < 10){
        console.log(a);
        a += 2; // a = a + 2;
    }

    Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 [odd numbers will show]

    *let a = 1;
    while(a < 7){
        if(a % 2 == 0)
        console.log(a, "is even");
        
        else
        console.log(a, "is odd");

        a += 1; // a = a + 1;
    }

6. You can use FOR LOOP or WHILE LOOP. There is only difference in writing syntax, Nothing else.

7. what is function in JS?
    - *A block of code
      *A set of statements that performs a task when it is called.
      *Maintains a relationship with input and output.
